# Imba TodoMVC Example

> if ruby and react had an indentation-based child, what would it look like? Imba is a new programming language for the web that compiles to performant and readable JavaScript. It has language level support for defining, extending subclassing, instantiating and rendering dom nodes.
> Declarative views are compiled to a [memoized dom](http://imba.io/guides/advanced/performance#performance), which is an order of [magnitude faster](https://somebee.github.io/dom-reconciler-bench/index.html) than todays virtual dom implementations.
